\subsection{Case}
The project is carried out as part of the ReRide initiative\cite{article:reride}, which investigates how technology can help rehabilitate back problems caused by riding motorbikes in the traffic. This Bachelor project's focus is how a Cloud based "Internet of Things" (IoT) system can pose as platform for existing and coming parts of ReRide. This leads to the following problem definition and underlying issues.
