\section{Method}
As part of the ReRide project, it will be necessary to work with a flex sensor, which through a micro controller transmits data to a Internet connected device, which the user carries. This device must be connected to a Cloud based IoT platform in order to evaluate and publish information to connected devices. Throughout the project the following activities will be relevant:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Setup of micro controller, as well as communication to flex sensor
	\item Data transmission from micro controller to mobile device
	\item Data transmission from device to the Cloud
	\item Data processing on a Cloud based IoT platform, including evaluation criteria for data and appropriate API for connected "things"
	\item Test of system
	\item Report
\end{itemize}

In order to quickly being able to see results and work from these the project will mainly be carried out through prototyping. Depending on the IoT-platform it may be necessary to learn a new programming language as well as Internet protocols. During the project, findings will be reported. Furthermore the states problem issues will be answered from literature and relevant sources in order to support the field of the project.
